#15MAT302 Numerical Methods – Project

Amrita School of Engineering, Amritapuri, Mechanical Engineering

All the methods here are implemented by R Abhinandan-AM.EN.U4ME18040 on MATLAB.

This is strictly for educational purpose and only use it as a reference, implement the methods on your own. 

Plagiarising the code can get you into trouble, do it at your own risk. 

Do not use the functions I have used. 

Do not copy paste the code for your assignmnets or projects.
